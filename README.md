## Website V2.

This is my website hosted on Github Pages. I am currently adding some updates and projects to this website.

This is my homepage - <a href="https://cjts15.github.io/" target="blank">Hello! I'm CJ</a>.

### Here are my projects so far.
1. LinkTree Alternative (Links) - <a href="https://cjts15.github.io/links" target="blank">Links</a>
- This is my simple website that mimics the functionality of the famous LinkTree. I got inspired of the idea and eventually I created one.
2. Beshifier - <a href="https://cjts15.github.io/beshifier" target="blank">Beshifier</a>
- A simple web app that replaces a space with an emoji (ðŸ¤¸) like this. This idea was inspired by other developers and it was originated by a meme on Facebook.
