## Website V2.

This is my website hosted on Github Pages. I am currently adding some updates and projects to this website.

This is my homepage - <a href="https://cjsabijon.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Hello! I'm CJ</a>.

### Here are my projects so far.
1. LinkTree Alternative (Links) - <a href="https://cjsabijon.vercel.app/links" target="_blank">Links</a>
- This is my simple website that mimics the functionality of the famous LinkTree. I got inspired by the idea and eventually, I created one.
2. Beshifier - <a href="https://cjsabijon.vercel.app/beshifier" target="_blank">Beshifier</a>
- A simple web app that replaces a space with an emoji (ðŸ¤¸) like this. This idea was inspired by other developers and a meme on Facebook originated it.
3. AnimeLibrary - <a href="https://cjsabijon.vercel.app/animelibrary" target="_blank">AnimeLibrary</a>
- A simple anime library web app created with NextJS13 and TailwindCSS. The anime API that is used in this project is from <a href="https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/#" target="_blank">Kitsu API</a>
